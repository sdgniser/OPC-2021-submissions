# NISER Outreach Program Website

My submission for the [NISER Outreach Page Competition](https://www.niser.ac.in/~smishra/event/opc/).

## Beware

- The menu misbehaves in Firefox. When I click a link it doesn't always leave me at the correct place. Works fine on Chromium based browsers. Not sure why this is happening, and hence not sure what the fix is.

## Improvements

There are a lot of visual and UI improvements that can be made, so many that it is not worth listing them all out. Peformance improvements, on the other hand, are only a few. They may result only in marginal differences, though, because the website is already quite performant. In the order of importance, they are

- Defer non-critical css by splitting the css file into parts.
- Lazy load images. Tried this, but resulted in a wrecked gallery section for whatever reason. Not had time to investigate.
- Throttle for event listeners in the scripts.
